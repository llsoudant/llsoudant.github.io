## Welcome!

Thanks for stopping by! My name is Lindsay Soudant and I'm a future Registered Early Childhood Educator.

### Teaching Philosophy

My teaching philosophy can be summed up as this: Children and educators learn from each other.

What does this mean?

It means that children will find ways to learn that teachers won't imagine in their planning. A nature activity turns into sensory exploration, or art free play transitions to a math lesson. When children engage with learning materials beyond what educators expect of them, then educators have the chance to learn how those children think and learn, and that in turn gives educators the chance to learn new ways to teach.

How Does Learning Happen? Ontario’s Pedagogy for the Early Years assures early childhood educators that children are curious, capable, and willing to learn - as long as their needs are properly supported. That makes it the educator's responsibility to learn what those needs are, so they can provide support where and when necessary. And that's not just limited to the classroom: establishing good relationships with caregivers and colleagues is important to ensure that every child:
   feels they belong, in and out of the classroom;
   knows they are free to express themselves;
   are engaged in their play and learning;
   and can trust that their well-being is secured.

Similarly the ELECT document, or Early Learning for Every Child Today: A framework for Ontario early childhood settings provides a guideline for what to expect at each developmental phase, and every child is different! Some children may dash ahead of their peers before reaching a plateau in their development; others may lag behind, only to catch up to their peers all at once. As educators, we are challenged not to judge a child for where they are in their developmental journey, only ensure that we provide learning opportunities that are developmentally appropriate. The education a child receives in their early years defines how that child approaches learning for the rest of their life - we must take care not to stifle that thirst for knowledge through inattention.

### Looking Back and Move Forward

My education journey through early childhood education has been a long one - a whole five years. In those five years I started a full-time program during the COVID-19 pandemic, transitioned to part-time to better suit my learning needs, fell ill with a chronic condition that paused my entire life for over a year, and finally returned to my ECE program in May of 2025. It's been quite a rollercoaster!

Getting back to learning was both thrilling and terrifying. The last efforts I'd been able to make towards my education had been in late 2023 - did I even remember what I'd learned in years previous? And more importantly, I was going into a classroom for the first time for a placement, as my level 1 placement took place during lockdowns and was delivered in a virtual environment. I was so nervous - what if I got things wrong? What if I forgot something crucial?

Here's the thing: I did get things wrong. I did forget something crucial at times. But that's why I was in placement, in college - to learn from seasoned educators who could catch my mistakes and help guide me to be better.

Don't get me wrong, I worked hard and did my best to study notes I'd made in prior classes. But all the hard work in the world means nothing if you don't have someone who can say "hey, this isn't quite right." Otherwise you just end up making the same mistakes over and over again, never realizing that you can do better.

So now I'm saying thank you. Thank you Jenna, Katie, Kate, Tori, and all of the educators who I had the privilege of learning from in person. Thank you Diane, Erin, Susan, Alanna, and all of my professors in the Early Childhood Education program at St. Lawrence College, who put up with my questions time and time again to ensure I could understand the material they painstakingly assembled. Thank you to the child care centres who opened their classrooms to me and supported my educational journey. Without all of these people and institutions I would not be where I am today.
